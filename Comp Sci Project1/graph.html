<p class= HODVC>My earliest memory was when I was about four or five years old. 
It with my grandpa and we would always eat our favorite food, pickles. 
So we would literally have a jar every single day. Also, we would go 
to Tomboys to get pastrami sandwiches all the time. He impacted my life
 because he was the one guy that was around all the time, I was always 
 around girls, but it's also vice versa to him because he didn't go out 
 with any male or male siblings and I was that person. I was like his son. 
 I feel like family is very important. This isn't my situation but even 
 if your family isnâ€™t very supportive of you and your choices, they still 
 love you at the end of the day. My family has been very supportive of me
 with my insecurities. What bothers me most about myself is that I worry 
 about what other people think about. My parents have given me talks about 
 it and over the summer, I've really gained my confidence.

In this project I learned how a lot about photography and interviewing people. With the photography 
I learned that you shouldn't be afraid to try new things. With interviewing I learned that you should 
have a lot of questions prepared and asking follow up questions can help you get better information 
about your subject.
