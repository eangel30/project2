"Universe Storyboard"
</h2>
<h3>
Welcome to my Chemistry page. For this project we had to tell the story of how the universe started using
a storyboard. We had to include: 
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Use and cite 4-5 pieces of relevant evidence</li>
	<li>A cited/bibliography page </li>
	<li>Clearly integrate both SEPs targeted </li>
	<li>Visually appealing and creatively communicate and tell the story </li>
	<li>Include 1-2 different cultural origin stories </li>
	<li>Include remaining unanswered scientific questions you still have even after researching </li>
</ol>

I learned how the universe began. I also learned why the Big Bang Theory is a credible theory 
and all the evidence that supports it. I can use these skills in the future because I know how 
to plan out the storyboard and to have my evidence first before building.
