"Linear Box"
</h2>
<h3>
Welcome to my Algebra 2 page. For this project we had to create a 3D box in desmos using linear equations as well as domain and range.

In this project I learned how to use domain and range to make a linear box. I also had a lot of difficulty
when trying to animate my lid with the shading. With help I eventually understood what to do and why we 
do that. In the future I know how to animate things in desmos and I also got more familiar with inequalities.
